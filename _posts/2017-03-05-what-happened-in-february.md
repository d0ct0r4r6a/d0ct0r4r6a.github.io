title: What Happened in February?
---

## How's it going?

February was a month full of twists and turns. I was on 3 different flights in one week time. I went to Singapore on the 8th to attend NTU Career Fair the next day. And I stayed for 3 days there till my sister finished her entrance exam. I know I had said this in person, but to whomever lent a hand for me, I am very much grateful â€” I will repay your kindness in time.

## I learned...

Since I moved in to Jakarta, I had more learning resources within my reach. Though I haven't had a fixed learning path. In summary, I learned what Test-Driven Development is (which gave me something to discuss with my interviewers in BCA), how to use frameworks such as Angular and React, and some new stuff from ES6.

More likely than not, you would like to know how I have turned all those learning to real projects. You have to wait the next post for that. ;) 

"What's next?" is also a good question. For March, I am planning to deep dive the React environment. It's no use to read much about frameworks, MVC, without getting your hands dirty on a particular framework. As for my reason in choosing React, I just heard one big tech-based Indonesian company was using React for their front-end so yeah... 

## On a side note...

I told you [my old blog](https://sparkitmyway.wordpress.com) was being shut and this new blog's taking its place. Hehehe...changed my mind. Here, you will read posts about my programming journey: resources, TILs, TIFUs, career-related, and whatnot. While the other blog, it's more like an experimental ground, a **curcol** (translation: contemplation, ranting, and the like) place, and everything else about me.
