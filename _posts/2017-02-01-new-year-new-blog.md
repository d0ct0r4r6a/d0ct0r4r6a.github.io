Hi! A warm welcome to you! 

### Intro

My name is Arga Saragih. I am an Indonesian-Bataknese guy. I graduated with
a degree in *Electrical Engineering* from Nanyang Technological University.
I am disposed to programming and tinkering stuff. This year, I am determined to 
land a job as a Front-End Developer.

### About this website

This website is built by Jekyll with the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde") theme. I am planning to discontinue 
[my previous blog](https://sparkitmyway.wordpress.com) and start writing here. 
Also, it will serve as the main page for my Github projects.

But, as you can see, it's pretty dull now. Check back later!
